# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## Traditional IT Infrastructure

### Hardware and Software Basics
- Computers and networking devices form the hardware base
- Software applications drive business efficiency and productivity

### Common Business Applications
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
- Asset Management
- Business Intelligence
- Marketing Automation
- Communication Management
- Human Resources
- Mobility Management
- Content Management Systems (CMS)

### Varying IT Needs
- Small companies: Minimal server requirements
- Larger companies: Dedicated IT rooms or data centers
  - Multiple racks, servers, networking devices
  - Complex cabling and cooling systems

## Evolution to Data Centers
- Large-scale facilities designed for IT infrastructure
- Specialized construction and layout
- Efficient cooling and cable management
- Various server rack configurations (1U, 2U, 3U)
- Specialized storage servers (HDDs, SSDs)
- Storage Area Network (SAN) technology

## Cloud Computing Concept

### Definition
Cloud computing offers IT resources through the internet, eliminating the need for on-premises infrastructure.

### Key Features
1. Flexible resource allocation
   - Scale from 1 to 10,000+ servers
   - Rent partial or multiple "virtual IT rooms"
2. On-demand networking devices
3. Pay-as-you-go model
4. Access to both hardware and software services

### Cloud vs. Web Hosting
- Cloud: Scalable, flexible IT resources
- Web Hosting: Limited to predefined server packages

### Types of Cloud Services
1. Foundation Services (Hardware)
2. Application Services (Software)
3. Deployment and Management Services

## Summary
Cloud computing provides scalable IT services over the internet, offering businesses flexibility in hardware and software resources without the need for physical infrastructure management.



# Cloud Delivery Models and IT Stack

## IT Delivery Stack

The IT delivery stack consists of several layers, each with its own components. Understanding this stack is crucial for grasping cloud delivery models.

### Stack Layers (from bottom to top):

1. Network
2. Storage
3. Servers (Processor, RAM)
4. Virtualization
5. Operating Systems
6. Runtime
7. Data
8. Applications

Each layer in this stack has its own set of components and complexities.

## On-Premises Model

In the on-premises model:

- The entire IT stack is located at the client's site
- The client is responsible for managing the entire stack
- This includes all aspects of maintenance and operation

**Note**: Some cloud providers, like AWS, can provide a physical rack to the client, but the management responsibility remains with the client.

## Cloud Delivery Models

Cloud delivery models determine how the IT stack is divided between the client and the service provider (cloud provider). The division of responsibilities varies depending on the chosen model.
